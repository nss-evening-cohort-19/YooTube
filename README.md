#### 3. Clone your new repo to your local machine
#### 4. Go to the **NEXT** section

## Starting the Project
1. Open the `package.json` file and change the `name` property to the name of your application, and `author` to  your name.
1. From your command line, be in the root directory and run `npm install` OR `npm i` for short.
1. Next, run `npm run prepare`. This command sets up husky to track eslint errors on commit that will make your deploy fail on Netlify.
1. To start your application, run `npm run dev`. THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU WILL USE TO RUN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER FROM NOW ON.
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

### If you see this, you are set to go!

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Using Axios
> For every file you will need to make an XHR request in, you will need to require Axios
```js
import axios from 'axios';

const examplePromise = () => {
  axios.get('http://localhost:3001/example')
    .then((data) => {
      console.warn(data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
    });
});
```

### Deploying on Netlify
Netlify will automatically detect your project and prepopulate the settings, but should something go wrong and it does not, here are the commands:

- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`

#### Additional Steps to Take on Netlify
- Add Environmental Variables
    - Any Enviromental variables you are using in your `.env` file should be added to Netlify. 
        - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment > Environment variables and the keys and values there.
