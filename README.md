# Welcome to YooTube!

This is the final front-end group project for NSS cohort E-19. We were tasked with making a clone of Youtube. This was a two-week sprint, with open guidelines on how to approach the project. 

It was challenging and fun deciding on which features we felt were within our capabilities, and we definitely pushed ourselves!
